# sovtech-assignment
## Practical assignment for Sovtech
- In this project I use apollo graphql with typescript on both backend and front end
- I tried to do this assignment a bit differently by adding a few jokes to the UI when pressing a category or a button
- There is still quite a bit I could do but I think this shows off some front and backend skills

## TODO
- add test and comments for backend
